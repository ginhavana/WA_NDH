## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. Overview  
Communication has always been one of the fundamental need of human being since the ability to talk and origin of language. Communication methods have also gone a long way from direct conversation, where individuals have to be in the same closed space, to long distance communication through long-waiting writing, to phone call, to sms, emails and voice mails that wait to be checked, to recently direct real-time back and forth chatting and calling with video, which also known as video call. The Internet development in this era has great impact on contributing to improve effectiveness of working, learning and social organizing, which includes distance communincation. Video Meeting (Conference) has been generally taken into account for years as a focused method of distance communication and particularly focused in the situation of Corona Pandemic, where people have to isolate themselves to stay and work at home (home office) most of the time. Here are quick summary of currently popular VC methods.

There are two different current methods to form a Video Conference: 
| Method | Highlight tools | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Technical | Jitsi, Zoom, Big Blue Button | Here switch the participants technically to another session (i.e. another "room"). You can no longer see anything except this room, so you cannot see what is going on outside the room or where a friend has "moved" to. |
| Avatar | Workadventu.re (WA), Wonder.Me (WM), Gather Town (GT) | The participant is shown as an avatar in a digital room and also sees all breakout rooms. Users can move in or out of these rooms by controlling their avatar on the screen. When entering a room, the participant only hears the people in the same room. They can still see who is in other rooms and make decision whether to change rooms or not. This behavior comes closer to our conventional social behavior. |

In comparison between these methods, there are some important properties that help choosing which method between different types of users.
| Properties | Gather Town | ***Workadventure*** | Wonder Me | Big Blue Button | Zoom | Jitsi |
| ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| maximum number of users |25 (free of charge)|***60***|1500|tbd|100|50|
| requirement of login/registration|no, except for cumtomized rooms|***no***|no, only moderators must register|no|optional|no|
| password security for meetings|no|***no***|no|yes|yes|yes|

### 1.2. Goals 
The goal of this project is a small research of Workadventure, one of the currently popular Video Conference (VC) method, which is known for having features that bring day-life familiar experience to users, to find and show its advantages, disadvantages and using difficulty.
Although Gather Town (GT) is similar to Workadventure (WA), the only upside GT has is Chat in Meeting, which is sometimes unnecessary since it's voice and video communication. WA also has larger number of paticipants. In comparison with Wonder Me, WA has better outlook with custom maps and humanlike Avatar, while Avatar in Wonder Me are only circles moving around in a blank space, which reduce load memory so that it has up to 1500 paricipant but then lack of characteristic to identify individuals, which is an important behavior of human that this project also want to focus on. Hence Workadventure is the choice for this project.

## 2. Workadventure for Campus Nordhausen
To achieve the goal, here is what I will do. First and for most, it is mandatory that I read through the documentation provided by Workadventure provider - The Coding Machine, along with watching some tutorial videos so that I will have some basic idea what I should do to custom a map and then host it. The next step is creating my own custom maps of choice. Then I will try to launch the map publically to see if it works and lastly I will try to host my custom maps on a private server.

### 2.1. Software System
Following the instruction of Workadventure Documentation, the [Tiled Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) software is the basic tool to create a custom map alongside with some different tilesets. WorkAdventure comes with a ["map starter kit"](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/workadventure-map-starter-kit) which contains a good default tileset for building an office and it proposes to use Github static pages as a public web-server which is both free and performant. It also comes with a local webserver for testing purpose and with Typescript support.
A Virtual Machine provided by Thomas HÃ¼hn will be used for private hosting server. For testing custom maps, it is required to have Windows Subsystem For Linux enabled and Ubuntu installed. It is also recommended to have basic knowledge about HTML and Javascript since maps are .json files, Linux commandlines and usage of Docker and Docker-compose
### 2.2. Map Customization
Learning how to create map on Tiled and reading some basic rules for custom maps from [Workadventure Documentation](https://workadventu.re/map-building/) are mandatory.
From that 5 maps with multiple layers that have access to each other are drafted.

#### 2.2.1.
The first map is **Campus yard** map. It is planed to have 4 entrances to access to 4 different places which are (2) **Library**, (3) **Mensa**, (4) **Audimax** and (5) a **Seminar**.  
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/167427269-38432496-7f84-46fe-901c-6a51fe8961c5.png" alt="Campus" width="500">

With this map, I have 12 layers drafted, which are, from above to below  

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/170034123-110b7c08-f9f6-4a85-9819-d825aedeb520.png" alt="Campus-Layers">

As mention in the Documentation, there muss be an above overall object layer named "floorLayer" to represent the Avatar instance of users, where the "override" layer above it normally contains all the roofs of objects that are above our head. For "object", "building" and "ground" layers I use some additional tilesets to decorate. There are some jitsi instances (layers) (identified by ![jitsi-Instance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/170035680-7e3a76b2-1825-459a-9897-f112e7725f22.png)) around the staircase in the middle of the map which connect to a jitsi room by these properties

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/170034538-ef9e0db5-80ea-420d-a925-80f773354da7.png" alt="Campus-jitsi">

|Properties|Description|
|-|-|
|jitsiRoom|(name of jitsi room)|
|jitsiUrl|meet.jit.si|

There are also 4 exit points and entry points to the other 4 maps so there should be also 4 pairs of "exitTo..." layer (identified by <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/170036288-bb1f3c24-c3a4-4d05-95e1-beb3b3a48dc4.png" alt="exit-Instance" width="40px">) which has property to redirect to other maps

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/170037432-346c80aa-f987-4f80-a73c-f209ea6a8c0e.png" alt="exitUrl">

|Properties|Description|
|-|-|
|exitUrl|(path to .json file)|

and "startFrom..." layer (identified by <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/170036377-1cca3189-afe9-4248-85e5-c3a82226b86c.png" alt="start-Instance" width="40px">) which initializes users' Avatar when they return from other maps

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/170038776-605dc8d9-3a6c-46f4-a97d-4e4dc6c45acf.png" alt="startLayer">

|Properties|Description|
|-|-|
|startLayer|Boolean value "checked"|

The "start" layer beneath almost every layers is used for initializing users' Avatar the first time they load the program. It is identified by <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/170040029-ebedbece-2a94-4c89-a242-196bfa232774.png" alt="start" width="40px">
The "collide" layer at the bottom is used for representing all unpassable obstacles such as hard objects or boulders. It is identified by <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/170040875-95ff83cf-5d59-4156-be02-15b6ac7b3137.png" alt="collide-Instance" width="40px">
The start, exit, collide and Jitsi instances are similar among all maps.

#### 2.2.2. Library map
The second map, whose entrance is at the bottom of Campus map, is **Library** map

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/171138699-dbb3a062-5747-445d-ad4e-a76d9de443be.png" alt="Library" width="500">

This map contains a locker room section below the entry point, a reception section above the entry point, a small toilet, some shelves along the hall way and a study section in the bottom of the map.
There are 3 separated Jitsi instances for 3 tables in reception section and 3 Jitsi instances for 3 tables in the study section. All the furnitures and wall (black tiles) are designed with collide instances.

#### 2.2.3. Mensa map
The third map, whose entrance is at the top left of Campus map, is **Mensa** map

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/171282241-86ab3acc-6aeb-445e-bbbf-9054673320f2.png" alt="Mensa" width="500">

This map contains a lot of small tables, for each a corresponding Jitsi instance is given.

#### 2.2.4. Audimax map
The forth map, whose entrance is next to Mensa entrance, is **Audimax** map

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/171282241-86ab3acc-6aeb-445e-bbbf-9054673320f2.png" alt="Audimax" width="500">

This whole map has the same Jitsi instance because it is required that all users in the room listen to the moderator on the stage section.

#### 2.2.5. Seminar map
The third map, whose entrance is at the top right of Campus map, is **Seminar** map

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/171282764-abfb2b33-58df-4943-a054-2d7caac04819.png" alt="Seminar" width="500">

The Seminar map is basically a smaller Audimax.

### 2.3. Public and private map hosting
#### 2.3.1. Public hosting with Github server
After finishing customizing maps, all maps and related files will be uploaded to a Github repository for storing. Following the instruction provided by WA, their Github repo for map starter kit is cloned and all maps and related file are uploaded to 'gh-page' branch. Since the start map is not "map.js" as provided in WA repo, there must be a small adjustment in **index.html** file
    
| Line | Original code | Replace code |
| - | - | - |
| 22 | const url = `https://play.workadventu.re/_/${instanceId}/${host}${path}map.json`; | cconst url = `https://play.workadventu.re/_/${instanceId}/${host}${path}Campus_NDH.json`; |
| 27 | const jsonURL = window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host + path + 'map.json'; | const jsonURL = window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host + path + 'Campus_NDH.json'; |

Then go to **Setting** in the tools bar, go to **Pages** and change source from `root` to `docs` and press **Save**. There is a notice direct to the test web UI which has form **`<username>.github.io.<repo-name>`**.

The web UI looks something like this  

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/149631915-8623b31b-2ad1-41a6-a364-867977ad1df0.png" alt="testui" width="500px">

After clicking the link, it's time to explore!  

#### 2.3.2. Private hosting on Localhost  
Instead of using github as webpage to launch the map, this time the map is hosted right on personal computer. Simply by downloading [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), open Commandline or Powershell, redirect to the directory that stores the maps and run `npm install` and then `npm run start`, a web browser will be opened and look something like this

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/149632688-4aeac996-3057-40f2-9655-b56ad7086d62.png" alt="local" width="800px">

#### 2.3.3. Private hosting with Virtual Machine server
A Virtual Machine (VM) is provided by supervisor Thomas HÃ¼hn. The first step is to enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) since I'm using a PC that runs Windows OS and most of the tutorial for this methode are for Linux OS. WSL allows one to run a Linux command interface, my choice is Ubuntu, on a Windows PC. To do this, simply search for "Feature" in Windows Search

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/175833118-07b1300b-379e-43ec-b731-dd46de910172.png" alt="feature-search" width="500px">

to open Windows-Features table, scroll down to the bottom, choose to enable WSL and then press "Ok".
![windows-feature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66717834/175833189-afc3cfce-6bb7-45cc-a1bb-3a5c80120f75.png)

Then I install Ubuntu from Microsoft Store, run it and follow the instruction to create a virtual account for Ubuntu. It is recommended to check and update Linux Kernel regularly by `sudo apt update & sudo apt upgrade`, then read and follow the instruction.  
For accessing and communicating between personal PC and VM, I use [Secure Socket Shell network protocol (SSH)](https://www.keyfactor.com/blog/ssh-protocol/). The VM will work as a Client and my personal PC is server. The command to generate a SSH-Key pair is `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` with "-t" to set the type of key and "-b" to set the bit amount that the key contains. SSH Key pair contains 1 private key, which is saved on my PC as identifier for a connection request, and a public key that will be sent to either Thomas or Jonas, who managing and administrating the Virtual Machine, and saved there in an `authorized_keys` file which allows any connection request with the private key identify with saved public key is automatically allowed.  
After setting up a VM for me, Thomas informed me that the public ip address of the VM was `109.73.30.34` and later changed to `5.102.162.62` and the port number available for me to connect is 22010. The command to open a connection to VM is then `sudo ssh root@5.102.161.62 -p 22010 -i id_workadventureVM` which mean the connection is via ssh as root user at ip 5.102.161.62 and port 22010 with the private key identifier id_workadventureVM. After accessing the VM, the first thing I always do and is very recommended to do is checking for the updatable package for Linux Kernel and then upgrading them, just as the WSL.
The (Workadventure Repo)[https://github.com/thecodingmachine/workadventure] is then cloned to the VM by `git clone https://github.com/thecodingmachine/workadventure.git`. For
