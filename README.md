# Workadventure (Campus Nordhausen)
## Introduction:
### 1. Overview:
Communication has always been one of the fundamental need of human being since the ability to talk and origin of language. Communication methods have also gone a long way from direct conversation, where individuals have to be in the same closed space, to long distance communication through long-waiting writing, to phone call, to sms, emails and voice mails that wait to be checked, to recently direct real-time back and forth chatting and calling with video, which also known as video call. The Internet development in the era has great impact on contributing to improve effectiveness of working, learning and social organizing, which includes distance communincation. Video Meeting (Conference) has been generally taken into account for years as a focused method of distance communication and particularly focused in the situation of Corona Pandemic, where people have to isolate themselves to stay and work at home (home office) most of the time. This project is a small research for one of the currently popular Video Conference (VC) method which is known for having features that bring day-life familiar experience to users and to find and show its advantages, disadvantages and using difficulty as a reference for anyone who has interest in it.

### 2. Goals: 
1. Quick summary of currently popular VC methods and reason why Workadventure is choosen.
2. Workadventure experience:
    1. Experiencing creating a self-made map. The choosen inspiration is a map of Campus Nordhausen with at least 4 particular locations with potential for further development as a substitute learning method.
    2. Experiencing self-made map on workadventu.re provided server.
    3. Experiencing hosting a local server for permitted individuals as private server.

## Design Consideration[^1]
There are two different current methods to form a Video Conference: 
| Method | Highlight tools | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Technical | Jitsi, Zoom, Big Blue Button | Here switch the participants technically to another session (i.e. another "room"). You can no longer see anything except this room, so you cannot see what is going on outside the room or where a friend has "moved" to. |
| Avatar | Workadventu.re (WA), Wonder.Me (WM), Gather Town (GT) | The participant is shown as an avatar in a digital room and also sees all breakout rooms. Users can move in or out of these rooms by controlling their avatar on the screen. When entering a room, the participant only hears the people in the same room. They can still see who is in other rooms and make decision whether to change rooms or not. This behavior comes closer to our conventional social behavior. |

Since one purpose of developing and improving technology day by day is bringing the experience closer and friendlier to users, it is safe to say Technical method are not main consideration of this research. Two tools (Gather Town and Workadventure) develope the conventional behavior further, in which participants can also hear and see (via video) each other when their avatars approach in a certain radius. Therefore these two tools will be particularly taken into account.

However for general point of view, in the next part, Technical method will still be used as references to compare properties between multiple methods.

### 1. important properties as criteria for the choice of tools:[^1]
* Supported number of participants: up to 25, in exceptional cases up to 100
* Preferably using without login (i.e. registration)
* possible securing of a meeting with a password
* Optional waiting rooms for participants
* GDPR compliance
* Availability of plugins (Chrome) or apps
* integrated chat
* the possibility of setting up breakout rooms (group rooms for teamwork)
* the possibility of adding a virtual background to your own camera image
* the possibility for the moderator to mute all participants

### 2. Comparison:
| Properties | Gather Town | ***Workadventure*** | Wonder Me | Big Blue Button | Zoom | Jitsi |
| ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| maximum number of users |25 (free of charge)|***60***|1500|tbd|100|50|
| requirement of login/registration|no, except for cumtomized rooms|***no***|no, only moderators must register|no|optional|no|
| password security for meetings|no|***no***|no|yes|yes|yes|
| ability to set up a lobby for admitted attendants before joining|no|***no***|no|no|yes|yes|
| Web browsers-plugin|no|***no***|no|no|yes|yes|
| App|no|***no***|no|no|Win, IOS, Android|Win, IOS, Android|
| Chat in meetings|yes|***no***|yes|yes|yes|yes|
| Breakout rooms|yes|***yes***|yes|yes|yes|no|
| background customize|no|***no***|no|no|yes|yes|
| ability to mute all participants|no|***no***|no|yes|yes|yes|

Although Gather Town is similar to Workadventure, the only upside GT has is Chat in Meeting, which is sometimes unnecessary since it's voice and video communication. WA also has larger number of paticipants. In comparison with Wonder Me, WA has better outlook with custom maps and humanlike Avatar, while Avatar in Wonder Me are only circles moving around in a blank space, which reduce load memory so that it has up to 1500 paricipant but then lack of characteristic to identify individuals, which is an important behavior of human that this project also want to focus on. Hence Workadventure is the choice for this project.

## Instruction:
### 1. Software systems:
* Tiled editor
* "map starter kit" provided by workadventu.re that contains default tileset for building maps
* additional tilesets on google per topics

For this project and following the instruction, Tiled editor along with 'map starter kit' provided by WA are tools for creating custom maps. However it is not enough and I also have to find some other tilesets on google which contain my desire tiles. [^2]
[^2]:[WA Tutorial](https://workadventu.re/map-building/)
* a web-server: Github static page
* Node.js

These 2 tools are used for launching and testing custom map.

* Windows Subsystem For Linux: Ubuntu
* Docker and Docker-Compose
* Sample Repositories for WA

These tools are for hosting and launching private server.

After watching some basic Youtube videos about creating maps on Tiled, I have finished drafting out 5 maps that can be linked to each other. These maps are:
